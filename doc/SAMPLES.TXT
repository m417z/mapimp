• "Skip" action

  /[i]sREGEX

Skips the name if REGEX execution results to any match. "i" prefix is for case
insensitive matching.

[sample]
name: unknown_libname_2519
mask: /sunknown_libname_
applied:
[/sample]

[sample]
name: UnKNOwn_libName_1451
mask: /isunknown_libname_
applied:
[/sample]

• "Cut" action

  /[i]cREGEX

Cuts the substring that matched REGEX regular expression. "i" prefix is for
case insensitive matching.

[sample]
name: SysUtils::CompareStr(System::AnsiString str1; System::AnsiString str2)
mask: /cSystem::
applied: SysUtils::CompareStr(AnsiString str1; AnsiString str2)
[/sample]

[sample]
name: SysUtils::UpperCase()
mask: /icsysutils::
applied: UpperCase()
[/sample]

• "Replace" action

  /[i]rREPLACEMENT/REGEX

Replaces the substring that matched REGEX regular expression with REPLACEMENT.
"i" prefix is for case insensitive matching.

[sample]
name: str___0__1
mask: /r_/__
applied: str_0_1
[/sample]

The REPLACEMENT can contain percent character to insert matched substring to
the replacement.

[sample]
name: System::SomeFunc(int )
mask: /r__%__/System::.+\(
applied: __System::SomeFunc(__int )
[/sample]

There can be only one insert, so if multiple percents present the first one is
the only valid, others are ignored.

[sample]
name: System::SomeFunc(int )
mask: /r__%%%%%%__%%/System::.+\(
applied: __System::SomeFunc(__int )
[/sample]

To add a control character to a replacement, cover it with a backslash.

[sample]
name: System::SomeFunc(int )
mask: /r\%%\%/System::.+\(
applied: %System::SomeFunc(%int )
[/sample]

[sample]
name: System::SomeFunc(int )
mask: /r\/%\//System::.+\(
applied: /System::SomeFunc(/int )
[/sample]

[sample]
name: System::SomeFunc(int )
mask: /r\\%\\/System::.+\(
applied: \System::SomeFunc(\int )
[/sample]

• Using mask chaining

The masks are applied to every single name one by one in order of appearance
in the list. That makes us able to write mask chains that perform complex
modifications. 
Let's say I'm debugging MSVC6 application which is using ATL/STL. The method
declarations are too long, because of template params. So to make it more
comfortable to see method names I decide to cut those params. 

/r Hey, here is the comment! Empty regexes match nothing, so it works/
/r Cut basic types first/
/c(?<=<)[a-z]*(?=>)
/r Now cut redundant brackets/
/c<>

Unlike cut action, on each replacement iteration the matching starts from the
offset equal to the last match ending + replacement length. Nevertheless,
because of strange behaviour of lookbehind assertions, we avoid using empty
replacement here.

/r The rest of the stuff/
/r_/(?<=<).*?(?=>)
/r We are almost done. Now cut the artificial underscores/
/r<>/<_>

So, when I try to import the map file again, I get something like

std::basic_filebuf<>::_Init(_iobuf *,std::basic_filebuf<>::_Initfl)

instead of

std::basic_filebuf<char,std::char_traits<char>>::_Init(_iobuf *,
  std::basic_filebuf<char,std::char_traits<char>>::_Initfl)

which is much more convenient, imo.
